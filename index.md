## Welcome to Tashivagant

Hello!

My name's Tashi Sherpa and this is my rudamentary personal site for any and everything.  

If you're wondering what 'Tashivagant' means, well... 'Tashi' is just my first name, though it's English translation is roughly 'auspicious'.  'Vagant' means 'someone who wanders'. It comes from the Latin 'vagus' - 'wandering' and the suffix 'ant' - 'one who does ___'.

So 'Tashivagant' means something like 'Tashi who wanders' or 'auspicious wandering'.  Yeah, definitely kind of cheesey, but it's the best that my limited imagination could come up with!

I currently live in Japan and 'teach English' as an assistant language teacher.  I've done this job for far too long!

Anyhow, I hope you can find something useful or to enjoy here.  Whether it be amateur teaching activities and advice, rants, recipes, photos, or whatever I decide to post here.

How about we start with some photos.  Nothing special, just snaps from my run the other day (got six miles in!)

I don't know what birds they are.  They look too small for stalks, so I guess herons?
